# wxVulkanTutorial

wxVukanTutorial is a port of the Vulkan Tutorial at [www.vulkan-tutorial.com](https://www.vulkan-tutorial.com).

<h2>Requirements</h2>

This repository is set up to be built using Visual Studio 2017. If you wish to build using any other
toolset, you are on your own. I will, of course, accept any contributions related to doing so.

In addition to Visual Studio 2017, the following tools and libraries are required in order to build the
tutorial:
- wxWidgets version 3.03+
- Vulkan SDK
- GLM
- the file stb_image.h from the [stb collection](https://github.com/nothings/stb)

<h2>Projects</h2>

There are a number of projects in this archive. They correspond to various chapters in the tutorial:
- <b>HelloTriangle</b> contains all code up to the end of Drawing a triangle.
- <b>VertexBuffers</b> contains all code up to the end of Vertex buffers.
- <b>UniformBuffers</b> contains all code up to the end of Uniform buffers.
- <b>TextureMapping</b> contains all code up to the end of Texture mapping.
